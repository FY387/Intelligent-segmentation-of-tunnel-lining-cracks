# Intelligent segmentation and quantification of tunnel lining cracks via computer vision
Concrete lining cracks are an early and significant indicator that reveals information about the safety and durability of tunnels. Aiming to automatically, precisely, and rapidly detect tunnel lining cracks and extract geometric information for structural condition assessment, our research team proposes a novel tunnel lining crack segmentation network (TCSegNet) and establishes a framework for calculating key geometric parameters of cracks.

This repository provides some raw images of metro tunnel linings and their corresponding high-precision annotations, which are available for researchers to carry out experiments.
